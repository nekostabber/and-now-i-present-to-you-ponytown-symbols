# and now i present to you ponytown symbols

- some languages, such as japanese, chinese, russian, greek and english work in the game. i wont be listing those since its fairly obvious that people use them.
- things here are subject to change. this most likely isn't all of the symbols so feel free to ask me to add anything you find.
- no credit needed they're literally just unicode symbols lmfao
